# TVLookup ![Build Status (main)](https://github.com/Merovech/TvLookup/actions/workflows/dotnet-desktop.yml/badge.svg)

App for looking up the names of TV show episodes.  Uses the TVMaze API to get data that's not currently in the database.

Mostly an opportunity to play with Sqlite and Entity Framework Core, and maybe a few other libraries as I see fit.
